# Restaurant Reviews App Project

## Project Overview

**Project acceptance date: 29 July 2018**

**[Live preview](https://ajk-restaurant-reviews.netlify.com/)**

The Udacity **Restaurant Reviews** project is part of both the **Front-end Web Development** and **Mobile Web Specialist** Nanodegree. Students were expected to incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. The stage took a static design that lacked accessibility and converted the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. It also required the addition of a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for users.
